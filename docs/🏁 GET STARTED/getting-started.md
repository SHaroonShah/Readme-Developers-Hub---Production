If you are looking to build an integration, then our API solution will help you incorporate the intelligence of Intersoft SAPIENT into your software with minimal integration effort.

The Intersoft SAPIENT Developers Hub provides both new and current users with a step-by-step guide on how to set up a <Glossary>shipping account</Glossary> , <Glossary>shipments</Glossary> , and get started as a new user. Furthermore, this section covers the vital processes on how the business clients can utilise the API to carry out shipping activities with available carriers, as well as the technical details required to build this integration.

## Getting started

This section outlines the essential information on our APIs and steps to begin utilising the SAPIENT APIs, including setup instructions, authentication processes, and key functionalities that can be accessed through the API and SAPIENT's UI. Whether you are a developer or a business user, this section offers the necessary resources to seamlessly connect and optimise your processes within the SAPIENT platform.

**Intersoft SAPIENT API** enables you to create and manage shipments, produce labels and customs documentation, generate and print collection manifests. The API also allows you to retrieve reference data such as carriers supported by the platform and the countries where shipments can be sent, maintain your own data required for these, such as adding and managing shipping accounts and <Glossary>shipping location</Glossary> details.

**Intersoft API**is a fully RESTful service implemented using JSON messaging. You, as the customer, are responsible for sending JSON messages and for maintaining the capability of receiving JSON messages in the format described in this documentation.
